                    <p>
                        Florida State University’s ACM Student Chapter was organized in early 1990. Our primary goal is to provide academic
                        and social enrichment to each member, in order to enhance the individual’s experience at FSU, and assist in preparing
                        members for life after graduation. Below are some of the activities and events our chapter hosts.

                        being discussed. Workshops often cover an introduction to a programming language, library, tool, or other interesting
                        technology. Previous topics have included Python programming, Git, Machine Learning, and Unity.

                        The international ACM organization regularly hosts TechTalks featuring industry professionals, ACM award laureates, and
                        researchers from industry and academia. Past topics have included: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Big
                        Data and Data Science, Blockchain, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, JavaScript, Microservices, Python, Quantum Computing,
                        and more. Our chapter participates in the webinar, and invites all chapter members to attend. These talks are often cover
                        material at a more advanced compared to our chapter workshops. More information regarding ACM TechTalks can be found at

                        the company does, and the types of jobs available to applicants. These info sessions allow for chapter members to meet
                        recruiters face to face in a low pressure environment, learn how to be a competitive applicant, and ask questions about
                        a company’s workplace and culture.

                        Our chapter is closely affiliated with the <a href="www.cs.fsu.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at FSU. As such, 
                        we welcome faculty members to speak to our chapter about their research, and careers more broadly. This is an excellent
                        opportunity for members to learn about advanced topics in computer science, and life in academia, while also providing
                        faculty a medium to meet individuals who may desire to assist in research.<br><br>

                        One of the greatest uncertainties students have revolves around life after graduation. In addition to faculty, our
                        organization asks former chapter members to talk with current students about life in the industry, how to prepare for
                        life after graduation, and things they wished they had known or done differently while still in school.
